### How To Run The Program on Your Local Machine

**Please Run this program on a Windows machine/PC and i used "Python 3.7.3"

1. Unzip the zipped file
2. Open the project root folder in a terminal
3. Activate the virtual environment 
    Windows terminal:
      > sms-env\Scripts\activate
    Bash terminal:
      $ . sms-env/Scripts/activate
4. Run "python manage.py runserver" in the root folder terminal
5. Finally, open your browser and type http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Admin USERNAME: sms PASSWORD: sms123717)

Note: This is can only be run in the local machine, when you get a domain we can upload live (by then we might have finished the project).
And i am using sqlite3 for database (Thats just for development purposes and it dosen't need much configuration, when we upload live then we can switch to mysql)

Let me know if there is any problem

Thanks.
